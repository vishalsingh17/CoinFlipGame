<h3>Rules of the Game</h3>
<li>I use a uniformly distributed random number generator to produce a number.</li>
<li>If the number I generate is greater than or equal to 40, you win (so you have a 60% chance of victory) and I pay you some money. If it is below 40, I win and you pay me the same amount.</li>
<li>Now I offer you the the following choices. We can either:</li>
<strong>Game 1</strong> — play 100 times, betting $1 each time.</br>
<strong>Game 2</strong> — play 10 times, betting $10 each time.</br>
<strong>Game 3</strong> — play one time, betting $100.</br>
Which would you pick?
